"""compile_gf_constraints must safely traverse trees built with the new
grammar/Metonymy.gf constructors added to unblock the dominant
gf-parse-empty bottleneck (see docs/contextual-tower.md's "Coordination
and arbitrary prepositions" section and this session's history): AndS/OrS
(sentence coordination), AndNP/OrNP (NP coordination), and eight new
fixed prepositions (On/At/From/By/Over/Under/During/Near)PP, alongside
the original InPP/AboutPP/WithPP/ForPP. Metonymy.gf's abstract syntax
previously had exactly one clause-level category with no cross-sentence
or coordination structure at all, so real corpus sentences using
"and"/"or" or any preposition outside the original four could never
produce a GF tree in the first place.

The first attempt at the preposition expansion used one open-ended
`PrepPP : String -> NP -> PP` instead of eight fixed ones -- reverted
after a real CI run showed it created a genuine parse ambiguity (GF's
String category parses as "match any token", which combined with the
already-open OpenPN/Open* family to give some NPs a spurious second
reading), breaking three existing tests. A closed, named set per
preposition has no such ambiguity, exactly like the original four.

These are pure Python tests against hand-built GF tree strings -- they do
not require a compiled grammar. They exercise the tree-walker's contract
("if the compiler ever produces a tree shaped like this, does the Python
side handle it"), not whether MetonymyEng.gf's new rules actually compile
or parse real English (that needs the GF toolchain, verified only in
CI/.cursor).
