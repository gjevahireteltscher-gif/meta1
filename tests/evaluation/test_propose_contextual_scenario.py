"""Regression test for a real bug found via a real contextual-tower-
evaluation.yml run and a local reproduction of the exact same corpus
sample: WiMCor/ConMeC's "sentence" field is a discourse-level excerpt,
often several sentences long (a real sample from the corpus went up to
21), kept that way on purpose since propose_contextual_scenario.py's own
lexical_evidence deliberately scans the whole excerpt for context clues.
But Metonymy.gf's abstract syntax has exactly one clause-level category
(no coordination, no cross-sentence structure at all), so feeding the
*entire* excerpt to `engine parse` -- which run_automatic_contextual_pipeline.py
always did before this fix -- asked a single-sentence grammar to parse a
whole paragraph. This was found not by guessing but by fingerprinting
score_contextual_detection.py's "unrecognized" exit-1 failures down to a
single 32-character message, confirming a bare `raise
SystemExit("GF returned no lexicalized trees")` as the sole cause,
locally reproducing the real corpus-driven sample, and inspecting the
actual gf_sentence strings this script produced -- every one was the
full multi-sentence excerpt, verb substituted in place, up to 1966
characters long.

sentence_span_containing narrows gf_sentence to just the sentence
containing the action's own span, without touching action["start"]/
["end"], proposal["sentence"], or anything compile_gf_constraints later
searches within -- those stay relative to the full excerpt on purpose.
