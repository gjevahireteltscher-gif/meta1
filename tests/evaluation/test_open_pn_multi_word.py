"""OpenPN2/OpenPN3 -- the fix for the root cause found by
test_gf_parse_diagnostic_matrix.py's first real CI run: OpenPN's single
`String` slot matches exactly one token when parsing, so a two- or
three-word proper noun ("Henry County", "The Shipley School") never
completed a GF derivation at all, regardless of any sentence-level
grammar construction added elsewhere. This is very likely why three
consecutive contextual-tower-evaluation.yml runs each measured zero
effect from otherwise-correct, CI-verified grammar additions
(S-coordination+8 prepositions, then VP coordination, then
copula+generalized-relative-clauses+genitive): none of them can matter
if the subject/object NP itself can never parse.

Two things need to know about the new tree shapes:
- contextual_rule_compiler.py's ARITIES table (parse_gf_tree's own
  contract, covered by the arity tests below).
- _proper_lemma, which ModifyNP's PP-modifier composition-matrix path
  uses to look up a PP target's alias -- extended here the same way
  lexical_head was already extended for ModifyRelVP/ModifyRelCNVP, so a
  multi-word PP target ("a programme in New York") resolves its full,
  space-joined name instead of silently stopping at OpenPN alone.

These are pure Python tests against hand-built GF tree strings/direct
calls -- they do not require a compiled grammar. Whether the grammar
itself actually compiles and parses real multi-word names is verified
only in CI (this file's whole reason for existing is a real CI run that
already found the underlying bug, not a guess).
