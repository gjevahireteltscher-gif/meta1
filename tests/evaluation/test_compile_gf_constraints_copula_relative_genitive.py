"""compile_gf_constraints must safely traverse trees built with three new
grammar/Metonymy.gf constructors added together after two consecutive
contextual-tower-evaluation.yml runs measured zero effect from earlier,
individually-verified additions (S-coordination+8 prepositions, then
VP-coordination). Local diagnosis on the real corpus sample found why:
79% of sentences containing "and"/"or" *also* contain a comma marking a
different, still-unaddressed construction -- grammar gaps overlap
heavily within the same sentences, so single-construction fixes rarely
flip any sentence from unparseable to parseable. This batch closes three
more gaps identified from the same sample, all verified against the
pinned gf-rgl commit's actual source and none needing a *new* `open`
(SyntaxEng/ExtraEng are already open from earlier work, and ExtraEng's
only two collisions were already found and qualified):

- PredCopNP : NP -> NP -> S -- copula predication ("Henry County is a
  county in ..."). Compl/PassCompl were the *only* VP-building rules
  before this, both requiring a V2, so a bare "NP is NP2" sentence had
  no derivation at all. Via Constructors.gf's mkCl : NP -> NP -> Cl.
- ModifyRelVP/ModifyRelCNVP : NP/CN -> VP -> NP/CN -- generalizes
  ModifyRel/ModifyRelCN (hardcoded to a V2+object pair) to an arbitrary
  VP, via mkRCl's own general RP -> VP -> RCl overload (the one
  ModifyRel already routes through internally) -- lets a relative clause
  use Compl, PassCompl, or any future VP-building rule uniformly.
- PossNP : NP -> CN -> NP -- possessive/genitive ("Tolstoy's works" as a
  live construction), via Extra.gf's GenNP : NP -> Quant combined with
  the already-confirmed mkNP : Quant -> CN -> NP.

These are pure Python tests against hand-built GF tree strings -- they do
not require a compiled grammar. They exercise the tree-walker's contract
("if the compiler ever produces a tree shaped like this, does the Python
side handle it"), not whether MetonymyEng.gf's new rules actually compile
or parse real English (that needs the GF toolchain, verified only in
CI/.cursor).
