"""compile_gf_constraints must safely traverse trees built with
grammar/Metonymy.gf's PredConjVP/PredOrConjVP -- Phase 1 of the grammar-
expansion plan (see docs/contextual-tower.md and the plan file's
"Расширение GF-грамматики" section).

AndS/OrS (already shipped) only join two *full* clauses, each with its
own subject repeated in the surface text ("X did A and X did B") -- but
real "and" in corpus text is overwhelmingly VP coordination with a
*shared* subject ("X did A and did B", subject not repeated), which is
exactly why adding AndS/OrS plus eight new prepositions measured zero
effect on a real contextual-tower-evaluation.yml run: the sentences that
actually contain "and" mostly needed this shape, not sentence-level
coordination. PredConjVP/PredOrConjVP cover it via RGL's Extra.gf VPS/
MkVPS/ConjVPS/PredVPS machinery (verified against the pinned gf-rgl
commit's actual source, not guessed), using Constructors.gf's
presentTense/simultaneousAnt/positivePol/mkTemp convenience constants
(already reachable via the existing `open SyntaxEng` -- only ExtraEng
needed adding for VPS itself).

These are pure Python tests against hand-built GF tree strings -- they do
not require a compiled grammar. They exercise the tree-walker's contract
("if the compiler ever produces a tree shaped like this, does the Python
side handle it"), not whether MetonymyEng.gf's new rule actually compiles
or parses real English (that needs the GF toolchain, verified only in
CI/.cursor).
